# SDTP Examples
This repo hosts examples of using the Global Data Plane (Simple Data Markup Language, Simple Data Query Language, and Simple Data Transfer Protocol) to host, publish, and query data.  
Each subdirectory has server code, to show how to host data, and client code, to query it.  _It should be noted that the Simple Data Markup Language and Simple Data Query Language do not require network mediation!_ The SDTP package can be used entirely client-side to have a fast interface to query data.
